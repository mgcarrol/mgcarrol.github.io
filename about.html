      <img class = 'aboutme1' src = 'AboutMePic1.PNG'>
      <p class = 'about'>I am currently a sophomore pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration at the University of Michigan. I am fascinated by the intersection of these two fields, and I aspire to find creative technological solutions to business issues. As of now, my primary interest in Computer Science lies in web development, but I am also curious about ____.</p>
      <p class = 'about'>Outside of the classroom, I enjoy attending concerts and music festivals, taking photos, and exploring Ann Arbor. As a California native, I absolutely love the ocean and definitely miss it while in Ann Arbor, so you can frequently find me watching episodes of "Blue Planet" in my spare time. Also, sports have always been a significant part of my life, from being a multi-sport varsity athlete throughout high school to cheering on Michigan's incredibly successful sports teams. Maintaining an active lifestyle is very important to me, and I try to stay fit while at school as a member of M-Run, Michigan's running club.</p>
      <p class = 'about'>If you have any questions for me, or would simply like to chat, feel free to reach out on any of the platforms below. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
