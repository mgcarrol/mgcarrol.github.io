      <p class = 'blurb'>This past summer and the preceding semester, I worked as a marketing intern at ObEN Artificial Intelligence, a firm that is developing in the AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency spaces. During my time at ObEN, I gained valuable experiences from weekly "Blockchain 101" lessons taught by my boss to writing detailed blog posts to help readers better undertsand ObEN's technology to planning and attening monthly AI, Blockchain, and Crypto speaker events and helping out anywhere else I could. </p>
      <p class = 'blurb'>ObEN is housed within IdeaLab, a business incubator for innovative tech companies. When I first arrived at ObEN, the company only had about 30 employees. The opportunity to work in a start-up environment surrounded by so many fascinating companies taught me an incredible amount. The knowledge and experiences I gained through this internship have enabled me to understand and speak about my tech interests on a much deeper level, and have inspired me to pursue a career in technology.</p>
