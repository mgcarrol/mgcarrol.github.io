      <p class = 'blurb'>The Google Community Leaders Program has offered me the opportunity to work with CEOs and other key figures in small and medium sized businesses in the greater Detroit area. Advising these companies on best practices for digital marketing, and finding personalized solutions for them has provided me with a unique experience that allows me to help local businesses and simultaneously learn how to craft marketing campaigns and analyze large amounts of data.</p>
      <p class = 'blurb'>As part of my initial training for this program, I earned certifications in both Google Ads and Google Analytics and I am excited to continue expanding my skillset into more Google tools as well as learning how to perform more complex analytics on my own. Additionally, the various professional development days and one-on-one mentoring with full-time Googlers has offered an amazing insight into the tech space and has been an incredibly valuable resource for my professional growth.</p>
